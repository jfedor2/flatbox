This is the firmware I originally wrote for the RP2040 versions of the Flatbox ([rev4](../hardware-rev4) and [rev5](../hardware-rev5)). It is very simple and easy to understand and modify. It works with PC and PS3.

Since then, [GP2040-CE](https://gp2040-ce.info/) emerged as the de facto standard firmware for RP2040-based boards. It has many nice features like remappable buttons and configurable SOCD cleaner. You probably just want to use that instead of the firmware here. Go to the [GP2040-CE downloads page](https://gp2040-ce.info/downloads/) and get the UF2 file matching your board (Flatbox rev4 or rev5, *not* the Waveshare RP2040-Zero one, even if your rev5 board uses it).
